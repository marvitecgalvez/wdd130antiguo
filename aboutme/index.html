        <p>Hello! I'm from Lima, Perú. I'm studying Web Fundamentals and computer programming. I enjoy to play the Piano and Music Producing. I'm a learning lover.<p>
        <p>I'm having fun and a lot of new experiences in this course. I'm from The Church of Jesuschrist of the Later-day Saints and I love to serve others, teaching others gave me a lot of experience about knowing people and the great value of their souls.<p>
        <p>Everyday I try to be a better person, neighbor, friend, in other words I try to be like Jesuschrist teaches. That is my purpose of life, I believe in purposes in live. At the moment I'm making things that I never make before like studying in University, caring my health a lot, making new body excercices.<p>
        <p>Here in Perú we enjoy a new Temple from The Church: Los Olivos, Lima Perú Temple.<p>
